A simple **Python console game** where the user tries to guess the secret number within **3 attempts**.

âœ… Perfect for beginners to practice:
- `while` loops
- `if-else` conditionals
- User input and type handling
- Clean, readable code structure

## How it works:
- The program chooses a secret number.
- The user has up to 3 attempts to guess the correct number.
- If the guess is correct, the user wins.
- If the guess is wrong, the user will be prompted to try again until the attempts run out.
